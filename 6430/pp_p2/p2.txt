turnin code: pp_p2


Enhance p1 by supplying a port number to each of the ranks so they
can use it in MPI_Init etc.  It can be used to connect back to the
process running mpiexec and retrieve information such as how to 
contact other ranks.

Then, implement your own MPI that supports the following functions:

    MPI_Comm_rank 	
    MPI_Comm_size 	
    MPI_Finalize 	
    MPI_Init 	
    MPI_Send (just wrapper for Ssend)
    MPI_Ssend
    MPI_Recv
    MPI_Barrier

You only need to support MPI_COMM_WORLD for this project.

Place your object code into a library named libpp.a which 
test files can link against.

Compile and link the program previously named p1 as ppexec.

Have a makefile that will build libpp.a and compile and link
ppexec as well as any test programs that we develop.

I will cd to my dir containing your project files and type:
    rm -f libpp.a
    rm -f *.o
    make

Use turnin as in p1.
