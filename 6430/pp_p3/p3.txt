turnin code: pp_p3


Enhance your MPI library to support the following functions:

    double MPI_Wtime(void);
    int MPI_Comm_dup(MPI_Comm, MPI_Comm *);
    int MPI_Bcast(void*, int, MPI_Datatype, int, MPI_Comm );
    int MPI_Gather(void* , int, MPI_Datatype, void*, int, MPI_Datatype, int, MPI_Comm); 

Place your object code into a library named libpp.a which our
test programs can link against.

Have a makefile that will build libpp.a and compile and link
all test programs that we develop for this project.
