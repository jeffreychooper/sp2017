School projects for Spring 2017 (Pulled straight from cs dept computer at the end of a semester)

6300 is a networking class, but I can't remember exactly what I was doing. I think it might be simulating workflows.

### For the following classes, you can check the text file in each project directory for more specifics on a project

6430 is a parallel processing class in which I made an (incomplete) MPI implementation

6450 is an OS class, but we mainly implemented a sort of toy TCP/IP stack that allows processes to communicate
