6300 is a networking class, but I can't remember what exactly I was doing. I think it might be simulating workflows

6430 is a parallel processing class in which I made an (incomplete) MPI implementation

6450 is an OS class, but we mainly implemented a sort of toy TCP/IP stack that allows processes to communicate
