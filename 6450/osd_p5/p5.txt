TCP layer

    We will not be concerned about providing reliability, and thus do not
    need to provide sequence numbers for packets, etc.

    tcptest h1 h2 201 the_payload    # usable port numbers are 100-999
        causes a msg to be sent from h1 to h2;
        h2 prints when the message is received:
            h2 received tcptest from h1 for port 201 the_payload
        

APP layer

    We will assume that there is an ftpd running at every host.
    You can have them at routers also, but we will not test that.
    An ftpd is only able to receive data, it does not send data.
    An ftpd does NOT print any info until a connection is closed,
    at which point it prints all the data sent to it on the given
    connection.

    ftpd_conn h1 h2 201
        causes h1 to request a connection to the ftpd at h2:201

    ftp_send h1 h2 201  data----1
    ftp_send h1 h2 201  data----2
        cause data to be sent from h1 to to the ftpd at h2:201 

    ftp_done h1 h2 201
        h1 tells h2 to terminate the conn to ftpd at h2:201
